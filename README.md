# update_report

Update reports for Fasig

## Goals

- make a list of files based off hip number (00300.html)
- Take out all the unnamed horses
- See if I can get the difference in money
  - Don't put update horse if difference in update is little
- Get rid of the 3rd and 4th dam
- 

## What's needed to run

- A folder, 'source\original', with the original files
- A folder, 'source\update', with the updated files
- A folder for reports, 'reports'

## Steps

1. Read the files, and get 2 lists
   1. the source file list
   2. the hip list (this is less important because the horse files are already in hip order)
2. Get rid of horses that are withdrawn
